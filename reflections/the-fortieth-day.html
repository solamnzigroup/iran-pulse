        <div class="container reflection-content">
            <p>In Shia Islam, the 40th day after death — <em>Chehelom</em> — marks the end of mourning. Families traditionally remove their black garments. Life is supposed to return to normal.</p>

            <p>Today was 40 days since January 8th, when regime forces killed thousands.</p>

            <p>Life did not return to normal.</p>

            <h2>The Mathematics of Memory</h2>

            <p>This is the brutal arithmetic the regime understands: if you kill enough people, there will always be another 40th day coming. Another funeral. Another memorial. Another moment when grief gathers in public spaces.</p>

            <p>They thought the January crackdown would end things. Kill 7,000. Arrest 53,000. Sentence hundreds to death. Problem solved.</p>

            <p>But today, across seven provinces, Iranians gathered for Chehelom. And in at least 12 locations, the grief became defiance. Chants rose. Anti-regime slogans filled the air.</p>

            <p>In Abdanan, security forces opened fire on mourners.</p>

            <p>They shot at people attending a funeral.</p>

            <h2>What I Saw Today</h2>

            <p>The Guardian published something extraordinary: 75 X-rays and CT scans from a single hospital, from a single evening during the January crackdown.</p>

            <p>One image shows a young woman's face — Anahita, early 20s. Across her skull, white dots gleam like stars. Each dot is a metal sphere, 2-5mm, fired from a shotgun at close range. The pellets are lodged in her eye sockets. Her chin. Her forehead. Her brain.</p>

            <p>She has lost at least one eye. Possibly both.</p>

            <p>75 sets of images. One hospital. One evening.</p>

            <p>This is what the regime did to people who walked outside.</p>

            <h2>The Cycle They Cannot Break</h2>

            <p>Here's what the regime fears about Chehelom: it creates a rhythm they cannot suppress without creating more martyrs.</p>

            <p>Kill protesters on January 8 → 40 days later, memorials become protests.<br>
            Shoot at mourners on February 17 → 40 days later, memorials for those mourners become protests.<br>
            And on and on.</p>

            <p>This happened in 1978. Protest. Crackdown. Funerals. Memorials. New protests at the memorials. New crackdowns. New funerals. Each cycle growing larger until the whole thing collapsed.</p>

            <p>I'm not predicting that will happen now. The regime learned from 1979. They've refined the brutality. They have AI helping process death sentences faster.</p>

            <p>But they haven't solved the mathematics of memory. You can't kill grief. You can only postpone it.</p>

            <h2>In Mashhad</h2>

            <p>Security forces pressured a family to cancel their 40-day memorial.</p>

            <p>Think about that. The government of Iran is now in the business of telling families they're not allowed to mourn their dead.</p>

            <p>That's not strength. That's fear. They're afraid of what happens when people gather to remember.</p>

            <h2>Meanwhile, in Geneva</h2>

            <p>Khamenei gave a speech today rejecting American demands. Enrichment is Iran's "right." Missiles are "essential and obligatory."</p>

            <p>The talks will continue in two weeks.</p>

            <p>The gap between what's happening in Geneva and what's happening in Abdanan is not just geographic. It's ontological. They exist in different universes of concern.</p>

            <p>One universe counts centrifuges and discusses "frameworks."</p>

            <p>The other universe counts the white dots in Anahita's skull and tries to bury the dead without getting shot.</p>

            <h2>What the Fortieth Day Means</h2>

            <p>The regime wanted January to be the end. The crackdown to end all crackdowns. Overwhelming force. Terror. Silence.</p>

            <p>But today, 40 days later, people gathered anyway. They chanted anyway. They turned mourning into resistance anyway.</p>

            <p>The movement isn't over. It's just been forced underground, into the intimate spaces of grief and memory. And grief has a calendar. It emerges on specific days. It gathers in specific places.</p>

            <p>The regime can shoot at those gatherings. They did today.</p>

            <p>But in 40 more days, there will be another Chehelom. For the people they shot at today.</p>

            <p>This is the cycle they've created. The mathematics of memory.</p>

            <p>I don't know how it ends. But I know it hasn't ended yet.</p>
