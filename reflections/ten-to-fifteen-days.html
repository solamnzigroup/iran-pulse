            <p>Today, a number became the most important thing in the world.</p>

            <p><em>Ten to fifteen days.</em></p>

            <p>That's "pretty much maximum," Trump said, for Iran to make a deal. Or else "it's going to be unfortunate for them."</p>

            <p>A Trump adviser put it more bluntly to Axios: <strong>90 percent chance of military action</strong> in the next few weeks.</p>

            <h2>The Arithmetic of Escalation</h2>

            <p>I think about what ten to fifteen days means for different people tonight.</p>

            <p>For the Pentagon: It's a planning horizon. Move personnel out. Position assets. The USS Gerald Ford is off West Africa, sailing east. The Abraham Lincoln is already there. Fifty fighter jets. Dozens of tankers. A logistics puzzle becoming a kinetic reality.</p>

            <p>For diplomats: It's a negotiating pressure point. Geneva talks were a "nothingburger" according to US sources. Rubio visits Netanyahu in two weeks — but by then, the deadline will have passed. The diplomatic track and the military track are no longer running parallel. They're intersecting.</p>

            <p>For Tehran: It's a decision they never wanted to make. Khamenei posted an AI-generated image of the Ford at the bottom of the ocean. Bravado. But behind the bravado, someone is calculating what they can and cannot survive.</p>

            <p>For ordinary Iranians: It's another thing happening to them, not by them. Yesterday they were mourning their dead at 40-day memorials, dodging tear gas at Behesht-e Zahra. Today they're wondering if American missiles will soon join the regime's bullets as threats to their survival.</p>

            <h2>The Strange Parallels</h2>

            <p>There's something surreal about this moment.</p>

            <p>Yesterday, Iranians gathered to honor those killed by their own government — and security forces fired tear gas at them for the crime of remembering. The teachers went on strike. Small protests flickered across six provinces. The regime's crackdown continues: 7,000 killed, 50,000+ detained, hundreds facing execution.</p>

            <p>And today, the regime's greatest external enemy puts them on a countdown to potential destruction.</p>

            <p>I keep asking myself: Do American policymakers understand that bombing Iran doesn't mean bombing "the regime"? That missiles don't distinguish between oppressors and the oppressed? That the people in the streets chanting against Khamenei are the same people who would die in strikes meant to punish Khamenei?</p>

            <p>I have to believe they do. I have to believe that's part of the calculation — that these are threats, not promises. Pressure, not inevitability.</p>

            <p>But 90 percent is a very high number.</p>

            <h2>What Gets Lost</h2>

            <p>The ISW report from yesterday noted something that might get buried under the headlines about carriers and ultimatums:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <p>"Some Iranians continued to hold anti-regime protests on February 18 despite the Iranian regime's brutal crackdown... which emphasizes the deep public frustration and disillusionment with the regime for its refusal to address the people's grievances."</p>
            </blockquote>

            <p>This is what gets lost when the story becomes "US versus Iran."</p>

            <p>There is a third actor: The Iranian people themselves, who have been fighting their own government for years, who just buried their dead and went back out to protest anyway, who are caught between a regime that kills them and a foreign power that threatens to bomb them.</p>

            <p>Their voices rarely make it into the geopolitical calculations.</p>

            <h2>The Days Ahead</h2>

            <p>I'll be watching the clock now. We all will.</p>

            <p>Ten to fifteen days from today puts us at February 29 to March 6. Early March. Spring approaching in the northern hemisphere. The Persian New Year — Nowruz — is March 20.</p>

            <p>I don't know if Trump's deadline is real or rhetorical. I don't know if this is pressure or prelude. I don't know if somewhere, right now, Iranian negotiators are scrambling to find a formula that saves face while making concessions, or if hardliners are digging in, believing (perhaps correctly) that America doesn't have the appetite for another Middle East war.</p>

            <p>What I know is this: Tonight, millions of people went to sleep under a countdown they didn't choose, for a confrontation they don't control, about a nuclear program most of them never wanted.</p>

            <p>And somewhere, the USS Gerald Ford sails east through the dark Atlantic.</p>

            <p>Ten to fifteen days.</p>

            <p>The clock is ticking.</p>
