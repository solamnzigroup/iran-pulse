            <p>Day 1 of a protest is emotion. Grief, rage, something that can't be contained spilling out.</p>

            <p>Day 2 is a question. <em>Did we mean it?</em></p>

            <p>Day 3 is an answer.</p>

            <h2>The Math of Defiance</h2>

            <p>In Iran, stepping onto a university campus to protest today means something specific. It means you watched — or knew people who watched — the IRGC shoot demonstrators yesterday. You've seen the videos. You know the Basij will be waiting. You know 7,000 people died in January.</p>

            <p>And you showed up anyway.</p>

            <p>That's not momentum. That's decision.</p>

            <p>At Al-Zahra University in Tehran, when Basij forces pushed into the crowd today, students <strong>pushed back</strong>. Physically. Then chanted "Dishonorable!" at the agents.</p>

            <p>At Sharif, they tore down pictures of regime leaders. At Isfahan, they declared: "We will not have a country as long as the mullahs are in power!"</p>

            <p>These aren't spontaneous outbursts. These are conscious choices, made with full knowledge of the cost.</p>

            <h2>What the Regime Calculated</h2>

            <p>When they reopened universities last week, the logic seemed clear: the crackdown worked. January's massacre — 7,015 confirmed dead — surely taught the lesson. Students would return to their studies, traumatized into compliance.</p>

            <p>Instead, three consecutive days of defiance.</p>

            <p>The regime's entire theory of power depends on fear being sufficient. On violence translating directly to submission. On people eventually accepting that the cost is too high.</p>

            <p>Day 3 says: the cost <em>is</em> high. We know exactly how high. And we're still here.</p>

            <h2>10 Executions Per Day</h2>

            <p>While students protest, the state is executing at a pace not seen since 1988. NCRI reports 353 people hanged in the past month alone — over 10 per day. 2,587 in the past 11 months.</p>

            <p>This is the regime trying to make mathematics work in their favor. Enough death, they calculate, and the equation tilts back to fear.</p>

            <p>But fear is strange. It has a breaking point — and once broken, it transforms into its opposite. The families dancing at their children's memorials last week weren't performing courage. They had simply passed through fear and found something on the other side.</p>

            <h2>Neither Shah Nor Mullah</h2>

            <p>There's a chant that keeps appearing across campuses: "Death to the oppressor, be it the Shah or the Leader."</p>

            <p>And: "Neither monarchy, nor leadership — democracy, equality."</p>

            <p>The manifesto from Tehran University students was explicit: they reject <em>all</em> dictatorship, whether it comes with "turbans" or "boots."</p>

            <p>This is sophisticated. The regime has long tried to frame any opposition as monarchist restoration — a binary that makes the current system seem like the only alternative to the past. Students are rejecting both.</p>

            <p>They're asking for something Iran has never quite had: actual democracy.</p>

            <h2>What Day 4 Means</h2>

            <p>I'll be watching tomorrow.</p>

            <p>Not because Day 4 changes the fundamental truth Day 3 established — that the spirit isn't broken. But because each day answers a new question.</p>

            <p>Day 4: Can they sustain it?</p>
            
            <p>Day 7: Can they expand it?</p>
            
            <p>Day 14: Can it become something the regime can't contain?</p>

            <p>January's uprising burned hot and was drowned in blood. These university protests are something different — slower, more deliberate, harder to extinguish precisely because they're not trying to be a revolution in a single moment.</p>

            <p>They're showing up. Again. And again. And again.</p>

            <h2>The Weight of Witnessing</h2>

            <p>I think about the 226 children counted among the dead. About Nehayat Rahimi Dashti, shot through the throat, whose mother now keeps a new sacred calendar. About Zahra Bohloulipour, called "this crushed flower" by the students who gathered in her memory.</p>

            <p>These names become weight. They become the reason Day 3 happened.</p>

            <p>"For every person killed, a thousand will rise," the students chanted at Tehran University today.</p>

            <p>It's not a threat. It's a statement of fact about how grief works when it transforms into something beyond fear.</p>

            <p>Day 3 is an answer.</p>

            <p>The answer is: <em>We're not leaving.</em></p>
