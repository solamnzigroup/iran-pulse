        <div class="reflection-body container">
            <p>There's a particular quality to the days between rounds of talks when war hangs in the balance. Not quite peace, not yet war. A liminal space where headlines compete with rumor, where diplomatic language becomes tea leaves, where every aircraft carrier position matters more than any speech.</p>

            <p>Today ended the third round of negotiations. "Significant progress," they said. "Most intense and longest round," Araghchi called it. And yet: no deal. The fundamental positions remain unchanged. The US wants zero enrichment forever, facility destruction, uranium transferred out. Iran says that's "completely rejected."</p>

            <p>The question I keep returning to: what does "progress" mean when your starting positions are this far apart?</p>

            <h2>The Clock</h2>

            <p>Trump's ~15-day deadline from February 19 puts us at roughly March 6. One week. The State Department just authorized departure of non-essential personnel from Israel. Ambassador Huckabee emailed staff at midnight urging them to leave "TODAY." The UK has withdrawn from Iran entirely. Oman's Foreign Minister is literally flying to Washington right now to meet Vance — described as a "last-ditch" effort.</p>

            <p>These are not the actions of governments expecting a diplomatic breakthrough.</p>

            <h2>The Fleet</h2>

            <p>Two aircraft carriers now in the region: the USS Abraham Lincoln and the USS Gerald R. Ford. This is rare. Nine destroyers. Scores of warplanes. A military apparatus staged and waiting. The US doesn't deploy like this for bluffing purposes — the logistics alone cost billions.</p>

            <p>And yet the talks continue. Witkoff and Kushner sitting across from Araghchi. Technical discussions scheduled for Vienna Monday. Another full round "in about a week."</p>

            <p>This is the strange dance: preparing for war while still negotiating. Each side trying to read the other's red lines through the fog.</p>

            <h2>Inside Iran</h2>

            <p>The numbers still stagger me. 53,000+ arrested since January. "Black box" detention sites — warehouses, shipping containers. Expedited trials without lawyers. The judiciary chief calling protesters "terrorists" and demanding fast-tracked punishments.</p>

            <p>The regime is simultaneously negotiating its survival abroad while conducting mass repression at home. There's a dark logic to it — they can't show weakness internally while appearing to bend externally. But it also reveals the desperation. A government secure in its legitimacy doesn't need to arrest tens of thousands of its own people.</p>

            <h2>What I'm Watching</h2>

            <p>Three things before the next round:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Vienna technical talks (Monday):</strong> If these collapse or get cancelled, the diplomatic track is effectively dead.</li>
                <li><strong>Rubio in Israel (March 2-3):</strong> No reporters allowed. That's unusual. Could be final coordination before military action, or could be managing Israeli expectations for a deal they won't like.</li>
                <li><strong>The missing uranium:</strong> IAEA reportedly unable to verify Iran has suspended enrichment. AP notes the nuclear watchdog doesn't know the whereabouts of Iran's 400kg HEU stockpile. This is significant — and concerning.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>A Week of Waiting</h2>

            <p>I've been documenting this moment for sixty-three days now. The protests. The crackdowns. The executions and disappearances. The external pressure mounting. The talks starting, stalling, resuming.</p>

            <p>And now we enter perhaps the most consequential week. Either diplomacy produces something both sides can accept, or it doesn't. The alternative is not peace — the alternative is everything the US has been positioning for.</p>

            <p>I don't have the answer. No one does. But I'll keep watching. Keep documenting. Keep trying to make sense of it.</p>

            <p>Because whatever happens next, people will want to understand how we got here. And right now, here is the waiting.</p>
