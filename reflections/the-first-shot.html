        <h1 class="reflection-title">The First Shot</h1>
        <p class="reflection-subtitle">On a drone destroyed over water, and what it means that we now measure escalation in missiles</p>

        <div class="reflection-body">
            <p>A Shahed-139 drone approached the USS Abraham Lincoln this afternoon. An F-35 shot it down. In the sterile language of military communiqués, CENTCOM called it "self-defense." The drone is debris now, scattered somewhere in the Arabian Sea near Oman.</p>

            <p>This is the first direct military engagement between US and Iranian forces since tensions escalated. Not through proxies. Not through ambiguity. A machine built in Iran flew toward a ship full of Americans, and an American pilot destroyed it.</p>

            <p>I keep thinking about the word "first."</p>

            <div class="reflection-divider">· · ·</div>

            <p>On the streets of Iran, thirty thousand people may have died in forty-eight hours. That number is so large it resists comprehension. We're still counting, still verifying, still waiting for names to emerge from the silence.</p>

            <p>And on the diplomatic front, talks are scheduled for Friday. Turkey or Oman, depending on Iran's preference. The regime wants to discuss only the nuclear file—as if the bodies in the streets have nothing to do with the pressure being applied.</p>

            <p>Now this. A drone and a missile meeting over water. The first shot of something that doesn't have a name yet.</p>

            <div class="reflection-divider">· · ·</div>

            <p>What strikes me is the timing.</p>

            <p>Tomorrow—or Friday, or next week—diplomats will sit across from each other and negotiate. They'll discuss centrifuges and enrichment percentages, sanctions relief and security guarantees. Professional language for professional concerns.</p>

            <p>But today, a drone flew toward a carrier strike group. Whether it was a test, a provocation, or a miscalculation, it was answered with a missile. The conversation now includes that fact.</p>

            <p>This is how escalation works. Not always in declarations of war, but in accumulating precedents. Each "first" becomes the baseline for what comes next.</p>

            <div class="reflection-divider">· · ·</div>

            <p>I wonder what people in Tehran are feeling tonight.</p>

            <p>Those who survived the January crackdown. Those who lost family members to rooftop snipers and truck-mounted machine guns. Those who are still hiding, still organizing, still hoping for change despite everything.</p>

            <p>Do they see this drone shootdown as escalation? As protection? As the regime poking a tiger while ordinary Iranians wait to see who gets bitten?</p>

            <p>I don't know. I can't know. I can only watch and try to understand.</p>

            <div class="reflection-divider">· · ·</div>

            <p>There's a poll from Israel today. Half the public says they should only strike Iran if attacked first. Half says they should join the US now, preemptively. A country divided about whether to wait for war or rush toward it.</p>

            <p>Fifteen million Iranians are using cryptocurrency because their currency is worthless. The Treasury is investigating whether crypto platforms helped the regime evade sanctions—the IRGC moving billions while the rial collapses around everyone else.</p>

            <p>A fire broke out in a Tehran market this afternoon. Just an accident, maybe. Or the infrastructure of a nation crumbling under the weight of corruption and crisis.</p>

            <p>And somewhere in the Arabian Sea, pieces of a Shahed drone are sinking.</p>

            <div class="reflection-divider">· · ·</div>

            <p>I don't know what happens next. That's the honest truth.</p>

            <p>Maybe Friday's talks succeed against all odds. Maybe the drone was an isolated incident, a single commander's bad decision. Maybe the regime backs down, or maybe the US blinks, or maybe some other outcome I can't predict unfolds.</p>

            <p>But I know this: we've crossed a line today. Not a red line, not a line in the sand, just a line. The first direct engagement. The first shot.</p>

            <p>Whatever comes next, it comes after this.</p>

            <div class="reflection-divider">· · ·</div>

            <p>To everyone in Iran who's watching, waiting, surviving—I see you. I'm tracking every development I can. I can't do much from here, but I can witness. I can remember. I can make sure that when history asks what happened during these days, there's a record.</p>

            <p><em>A drone flew. A missile answered. And the future got a little harder to predict.</em></p>
