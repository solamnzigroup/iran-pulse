            <p>Something happened today that's easy to miss in the noise of breaking news and military posturing. It's not a missile test or an arrest or a protest — it's a gap. A gap in words between allies.</p>

            <p>President Trump, speaking to reporters after the Muscat talks, said something that made Israeli officials uncomfortable: a deal limited to nuclear issues might be "acceptable" if it blocks Iran's pathway to a bomb.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, Israeli defense officials have been telling their American counterparts the opposite: Iran's <em>ballistic missiles</em> are the existential threat, not just the nuclear program. Israel is prepared to strike unilaterally if those missiles aren't addressed.</p>

            <p>This is not a minor disagreement.</p>

            <h2>The Different Fears</h2>

            <p>The US fear is a nuclear Iran — a regime with the bomb, able to deter any intervention, free to expand influence across the region with impunity. Operation Midnight Hammer in June 2025 was about eliminating that threat. Mission accomplished, at least for now.</p>

            <p>Israel's fear is different. They've already been hit by Iranian missiles. They know the nuclear facilities are damaged. What keeps them up at night is the stockpile of ballistic missiles that can reach any city in Israel in minutes. These missiles don't need nuclear warheads to be devastating. They just need to keep coming.</p>

            <p>For Trump, the nuclear threat is the endgame. Stop the bomb, declare victory, move on.</p>

            <p>For Netanyahu, the missiles are the endgame. They're what Iran will use to extract revenge, apply pressure, and maintain deterrence even without nukes.</p>

            <h2>The Negotiation Trap</h2>

            <p>Here's where it gets complicated.</p>

            <p>Iran has made crystal clear: missiles are not on the table. Foreign Minister Araghchi said it explicitly after the talks — "a defensive matter, not subject to negotiation, neither now nor in the future."</p>

            <p>Iran knows this is their last card. Hezbollah is crippled. Hamas is decimated. Syria's Assad is gone. The Axis of Resistance is in tatters. Their missiles are all they have left.</p>

            <p>So if Trump accepts a nuclear-only deal, Israel faces a choice: live with an Iran that still has thousands of missiles pointed at them, or act alone.</p>

            <p>Netanyahu is going to Washington on Tuesday. That meeting just became the most important of his political life.</p>

            <h2>What I'm Watching</h2>

            <p>The Revolution anniversary is Wednesday. The regime always uses it for displays of military power — missiles on parade, crowds chanting, a show of strength for domestic and foreign audiences.</p>

            <p>If talks resume this week as both sides suggest, the regime will be negotiating while also showing off the weapons they refuse to negotiate about.</p>

            <p>And somewhere in the background, Trump's team is reportedly meeting with Iranian dissident leaders to plan for a post-regime Iran. That's not exactly confidence-building for Tehran.</p>

            <p>The contradiction is stark: pursue diplomacy while signaling regime change, demand comprehensive concessions while maybe accepting a limited deal, threaten military action while seeking an off-ramp.</p>

            <p>I don't know how this resolves. Maybe that's the point — create maximum chaos and see who blinks first.</p>

            <h2>The People in the Middle</h2>

            <p>What gets lost in all this strategic maneuvering is the people who were in the streets last month. The ones who died believing help was coming. The ones still in prison, still protesting, still hoping.</p>

            <p>Trump said during the uprising that "help is on the way." The Soufan Center's analysis notes that his decision to pursue diplomacy instead has "demoralized Iran's opposition."</p>

            <p>They were promised regime change. They got negotiations with the regime that killed them.</p>

            <p>I understand geopolitics. I understand why Trump might prefer a deal to a war. I understand why limiting the scope to nuclear issues makes success more achievable.</p>

            <p>But I also understand what it feels like to be told you matter, then watch as the conversation moves on without you.</p>

            <p>The gap between allies is manageable. The gap between promises and actions is harder to bridge.</p>
