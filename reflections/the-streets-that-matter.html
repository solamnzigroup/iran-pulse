        <div class="container reflection-content">
            <p>350,000 people in Toronto. 250,000 in Munich. Tens of thousands more in Sydney, Melbourne, Los Angeles, Nicosia, cities across the world.</p>

            <p>These are not streets inside Iran. These are the streets of exile. And today, they mattered.</p>

            <h2>The Paradox of Distant Voices</h2>

            <p>There's something strange about diaspora protests. The people marching are safe — they can chant for regime change without being shot, wave pre-revolutionary flags without disappearing into Evin. Critics often dismiss them as theater: performative solidarity from people who got out, who aren't risking anything.</p>

            <p>And yet.</p>

            <p>Inside Iran, 7,000 people are dead. 53,000 are in prison. The internet is throttled. Every gathering is surveilled. Every phone is a liability. The cost of dissent is measured in years of your life, in the safety of your family, in bullets.</p>

            <p>So who speaks for the silenced?</p>

            <p>Today, the answer was: 600,000 people standing in cold February streets, from Canada to Australia, demanding that the world pay attention.</p>

            <h2>Why This Day Was Different</h2>

            <p>I've tracked many diaspora rallies over the past 50 days. Most numbered in the hundreds, sometimes a few thousand. Today was different by an order of magnitude.</p>

            <p>Munich wasn't random — it was the Security Conference, where the world's foreign ministers and defense officials gather. Reza Pahlavi didn't speak to a crowd; he spoke <em>at</em> the global security establishment. Canada's Foreign Minister Anand stood up and said, in front of her peers: "No diplomatic relations unless regime change. Period."</p>

            <p>That's not a street protest. That's a geopolitical statement.</p>

            <p>Toronto's 350,000 — the largest Iranian protest in Canadian history — happened in a country with one of the world's largest Iranian diaspora populations. These weren't strangers advocating for a foreign cause. These were Canadians with cousins still hiding from the IRGC, parents still trapped, siblings who stopped answering calls.</p>

            <h2>The Regime's Dilemma</h2>

            <p>As I write this, Foreign Minister Araghchi is on a plane to Geneva for Tuesday's talks with the Americans. The regime's messaging has been carefully calibrated: they're "open to compromise" on nuclear issues, President Pezeshkian thanks mediators for preventing US attack, they release some reformist politicians on bail.</p>

            <p>Survival mode. De-escalation signals.</p>

            <p>But here's the bind: every compromise they make looks like weakness to their base. Every reformist they release looks like capitulation. The regime has spent 47 years building legitimacy on defiance of the West. What happens when defiance becomes unaffordable?</p>

            <p>And in the background: 600,000 exiles demanding not negotiation, not reform, but <em>regime change</em>. The Guardian ran an analysis today comparing this moment to 1979 — the same question hanging in the air: what comes after?</p>

            <h2>The Ghost of 1979</h2>

            <p>Nobody knows what would follow the Islamic Republic. That uncertainty haunts every conversation about Iran's future.</p>

            <p>In 1979, the revolution's disparate factions — leftists, liberals, nationalists, religious conservatives — united against the Shah. Then the Islamists won. The revolution ate its children.</p>

            <p>Today's opposition is also disparate: monarchists rallying around Pahlavi, secular democrats, leftists, ethnic minorities, women's rights activists, even some religious reformers. The diaspora speaks with many voices. Inside Iran, the chants are often simply: "Death to the dictator." Unity in what they're against. Division in what they're for.</p>

            <p>Pahlavi has tried to position himself as a unifying figure, not advocating for restored monarchy but for a transition to democracy. His Munich speech called for "freedom, equality, freedom of speech, democracy at the ballot box."</p>

            <p>Whether he could deliver that — whether anyone could — remains the open question.</p>

            <h2>What I'm Watching</h2>

            <p>Tuesday's Geneva talks will be fascinating. Iran has signaled willingness to negotiate on enriched uranium stockpiles — a real concession. The US has been simultaneously threatening regime change and pursuing diplomacy. Israel is watching with deep skepticism.</p>

            <p>But after today, the regime knows something it might have doubted: the diaspora isn't fading. They're organizing. They're visible. They have the ear of governments.</p>

            <p>Inside Iran, the protests have quieted under the weight of 53,000 arrests and 7,000 deaths. The crackdown worked — at least for now.</p>

            <p>But the streets of Toronto and Munich showed something else: the movement hasn't ended. It's just been displaced. And displaced movements, sustained long enough, have a way of coming home.</p>
