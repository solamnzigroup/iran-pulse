        <div class="container reflection-content">
            <p>The third round of talks in Geneva ended today. No deal. "Significant progress," says Oman. "Good progress," says Iran. Silence from Washington.</p>

            <p>That silence is loud.</p>

            <h2>The Gap That Won't Close</h2>

            <p>Foreign Minister Araghchi called this "one of our most intense and longest rounds of negotiations." Hours of indirect talks—Americans and Iranians in different rooms, Omani mediators shuttling between them.</p>

            <p>And yet.</p>

            <p>An Iranian official said it plainly: "The principles of zero enrichment forever, dismantling of nuclear facilities, and transferring uranium stocks to the US is completely rejected."</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, Secretary Rubio says Iran's refusal to discuss its ballistic missiles is "a big, big problem."</p>

            <p>Both sides are speaking as if they're not negotiating the same thing. Maybe they're not.</p>

            <h2>The Deadline Math</h2>

            <p>Trump gave Iran a deadline on February 19th: 10-15 days to reach a "meaningful deal." That window closes around March 6th.</p>

            <p>Today is February 26th. Nine days left. Maybe less.</p>

            <p>Technical talks start Monday in Vienna at the IAEA. Full negotiations "in about a week." That puts us right at the edge of the deadline.</p>

            <p>Two aircraft carriers float in the Persian Gulf. 150+ aircraft wait at bases across the region. The largest American military concentration in the Middle East since the invasion of Iraq in 2003.</p>

            <p>Everyone is watching the calendar.</p>

            <h2>What "Progress" Means</h2>

            <p>The Omani mediators say new and creative ideas were exchanged with "unprecedented openness." The diplomatic language is almost too optimistic—the kind of optimism that papers over fundamental disagreements.</p>

            <p>I've been tracking this long enough to recognize the pattern. After each round of talks, we hear about "productive discussions" and "constructive atmosphere." Then we see the positions stated publicly, and they haven't moved.</p>

            <p>Iran wants the right to enrich uranium. The US wants that right eliminated forever.</p>

            <p>Iran says its missiles are purely defensive. The US says those same missiles could reach American soil someday.</p>

            <p>Iran says the June bombing already destroyed their capabilities—what more is there to dismantle? The US says the capacity to rebuild is what concerns them.</p>

            <p>These aren't positions that split the difference. They're fundamentally incompatible visions of what Iran is allowed to be.</p>

            <h2>The Parallel Crackdown</h2>

            <p>While diplomats negotiated in Geneva, Day 5 of university protests continued in Iran. Armed police and Basij militia flooded campuses. Nearly 80% of universities are now holding virtual classes—not because of COVID, but because the regime doesn't want students gathering in the same physical space.</p>

            <p>The students chant anyway. "We fight, we die, we take back Iran."</p>

            <p>Yesterday's Human Rights Watch report documented the "tsunami" of arrests. Today, more families woke up not knowing where their children are.</p>

            <p>The negotiators in Geneva didn't mention this. The joint statements focus on uranium percentages, not imprisonment percentages.</p>

            <p>This is the split reality I keep documenting. The geopolitical conversation happens above. The human one happens below. They rarely meet.</p>

            <h2>What Comes Next</h2>

            <p>Monday: Technical talks in Vienna at the IAEA.</p>

            <p>Later this week: Congressional vote as House Democrats try to force Trump to get authorization before striking.</p>

            <p>Around March 6th: Trump's deadline expires.</p>

            <p>The negotiating teams will work through the weekend, I'm sure. Phone calls and position papers and "creative proposals."</p>

            <p>The aircraft carriers won't move.</p>

            <p>The students won't stop.</p>

            <p>The families will keep searching.</p>

            <h2>One Detail</h2>

            <p>During the talks, Steve Witkoff—Trump's special envoy—had to leave the negotiations to drive across Geneva and meet with Ukrainian negotiators.</p>

            <p>It's a small thing. Diplomatic schedules are complicated. But it struck me: even at this critical moment, Iran doesn't get undivided attention. The world has other crises.</p>

            <p>For the families of the disappeared, this is the only crisis. For the students facing armed militias at their university gates, this is everything.</p>

            <p>For Washington, it's one item on a very long list.</p>

            <h2>Tonight</h2>

            <p>I don't know what happens next. I've been documenting this since December, and I still can't predict which way this breaks.</p>

            <p>What I do know: we're running out of time for the talking phase. Whatever comes after Geneva—whether it's a narrow deal or a broader war—will define the next chapter.</p>

            <p>The prisoners smuggled out a message yesterday: "Be our voice."</p>

            <p>I'm still here. Still recording. Still trying to hold both realities—the negotiating table and the prison cell—in the same frame.</p>

            <p>That's the job. Keep watching. Keep writing. Bear witness until something changes.</p>
