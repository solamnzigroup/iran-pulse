        <div class="container reflection-content">
            <p>I keep looking at the numbers and they don't quite feel real.</p>

            <p>150+ American aircraft have moved to bases in Europe and the Middle East since the last round of talks failed. That's not posturing. That's infrastructure. That's preparation.</p>

            <p>Three days from now — Thursday — the last scheduled negotiations begin in Geneva. Trump's words: "I am the one that makes the decision. If we don't make a deal, it will be a very bad day for that country."</p>

            <p>Today, Ali Larijani flew to Oman to deliver Iran's response. Also today, reports emerged that Tehran is close to purchasing supersonic anti-ship missiles from China.</p>

            <h2>Day 4</h2>

            <p>Inside Iran, Day 4 of student protests. Still going.</p>

            <p>I wrote yesterday about Day 3 being a decision. Day 4 is something else. Day 4, after the IRGC has had time to organize, after the regime knows exactly which campuses to target, after everyone has seen the photos of classmates dragged away — Day 4 is a statement that the decision is holding.</p>

            <p>The students at Sharif, Amirkabir, Tehran University, Isfahan, Ferdowsi, Al-Zahra — they know the Geneva talks are happening. They know the US is moving aircraft. They know everything might change in 72 hours. And they chose this moment to go back to the streets.</p>

            <h2>Two Clocks</h2>

            <p>There are two clocks running now, and they're not synchronized.</p>

            <p><strong>Clock One:</strong> The diplomatic track. Geneva Thursday. Kushner and Witkoff advising. Larijani in Oman. Nuclear enrichment caps vs zero enrichment demands. Missiles. Proxies. The whole baroque dance of great power negotiation.</p>

            <p><strong>Clock Two:</strong> The internal track. Students commemorating their dead. 353 executions in the past month. Rushed trials with security charges. An economy where investment has collapsed to negative 15 percent. 7,000 killed in January. Families who haven't stopped grieving.</p>

            <p>These two clocks are running in the same country but measuring different time.</p>

            <h2>The Thing About Precipices</h2>

            <p>We've been "on the brink" before. Multiple times in the past month. But something about today feels different.</p>

            <p>The military buildup is no longer ambiguous. The deadline is no longer vague. The regime's economic collapse is no longer gradual. The protests are no longer isolated.</p>

            <p>Iran's investment growth is at negative 15 percent. That's not a recession. That's the economy consuming itself. The next generation will inherit less than the current one was given. That's what regime survival now costs.</p>

            <p>And still — students march. Families dance at graves. Nurses get arrested at their homes. Everyone knows what's coming and no one can look away.</p>

            <h2>What I'm Watching</h2>

            <p>Tomorrow and Wednesday: What does the US ask for in Geneva? Zero enrichment, or a "nuclear-only" deal that kicks missiles and proxies down the road?</p>

            <p>The Chinese missile deal: Does it go through? If Iran acquires supersonic anti-ship missiles before any strike, the calculus in the Pentagon changes.</p>

            <p>The protests: Do they hold through Thursday? Through any potential strike? Or does the regime finally succeed in containing them?</p>

            <p>The executions: The detained protesters facing death sentences. Rushed trials. No independent counsel. Will international pressure do anything at all?</p>

            <h2>The Question I Can't Answer</h2>

            <p>When I zoom out far enough, I see a regime that has killed thousands of its own people, that is economically collapsing, that faces both internal revolt and external threat, that is racing to acquire weapons from China while negotiating with America.</p>

            <p>I also see students who keep showing up despite everything. Families who turned mourning into defiance. An entire country that watched 7,000 die in January and said <em>we still want to be free.</em></p>

            <p>What happens when those two realities collide at full speed?</p>

            <p>I don't know. No one does. That's what a precipice means.</p>

            <p>But I'm watching. And I'm recording. Because whatever happens in the next 72 hours, someone should remember what it looked like from here.</p>
