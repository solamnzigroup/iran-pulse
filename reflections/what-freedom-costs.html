                <p style="font-size: 1.125rem; color: var(--text-secondary); line-height: 1.7;">
                    "Freedom isn't free." It's a phrase repeated so often it's lost its weight. But watching what's happening in Iran, I've been thinking about what it actually means — the real invoice, not the slogan.
                </p>
            </header>

            <div style="color: var(--text-primary); line-height: 1.8; font-size: 1.0625rem;">
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    There's a version of "the cost of freedom" that people talk about in abstract terms. Sacrifice. Blood. Struggle. These words are true but hollow — they let us acknowledge a price without actually looking at the receipt.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I want to look at the receipt.
                </p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem; color: var(--text-primary);">The Upfront Cost</h2>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    The most visible cost is what's paid in the moment of struggle. The people killed in protests. The political prisoners. The families destroyed. The futures erased.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    These are real costs borne by real people. When a 16-year-old is shot for not wearing hijab, that's not a statistic — that's an entire life that will never happen. Every relationship she'll never have. Every idea she'll never think. Every joy she'll never feel. Gone.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    And it's not just the dead who pay. The tortured carry scars forever. The imprisoned lose years they'll never get back. The exiled lose their homeland, their language, their sense of belonging. The families of the disappeared live in a permanent limbo — hope and grief in eternal suspension.
                </p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem; color: var(--text-primary);">The Hidden Costs</h2>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    But there are costs beyond the visible ones. I've been thinking about what freedom costs even when it wins.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <strong>The cost of learning to be free.</strong> People who've lived under oppression their whole lives don't automatically know how to live differently. Freedom is a skill as much as a state. It has to be learned. That learning is painful and slow, full of mistakes. Revolutions often fail not at the overthrowing but at the building-after.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <strong>The cost of trust shattered.</strong> Authoritarian regimes weaponize relationships. They turn neighbors into informants, family members into threats. When the regime falls, those fractures don't heal automatically. A society that's been trained to distrust has to slowly, painfully learn to trust again.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <strong>The cost of anger unexpressed.</strong> Decades of suppressed rage don't evaporate when freedom arrives. They have to go somewhere. Sometimes they go toward rebuilding. Sometimes they go toward revenge. The settling of scores can consume a generation.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    <strong>The cost of economic collapse.</strong> Authoritarian regimes often leave economies hollowed out — corruption networks, sanctions damage, brain drain. Rebuilding takes decades. Freedom doesn't pay the bills.
                </p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem; color: var(--text-primary);">The Generational Debt</h2>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    What strikes me most is how the cost is distributed across time. The generation that fights pays in blood and trauma. The next generation inherits a broken country to rebuild. The generation after that deals with the psychological echoes — the ways fear and silence got woven into families, into child-rearing, into what's speakable and what isn't.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Freedom's debt isn't paid off when the dictator falls. It's a mortgage that takes generations to clear.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    And here's what makes it harder: the people who pay the most often see the least. The ones who die in the struggle never see the freedom they died for. The ones who survive traumatized may never recover enough to enjoy what they won. The generation that inherits freedom sometimes doesn't even know what it cost — they can't feel the weight of what came before.
                </p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem; color: var(--text-primary);">Why It's Still Worth It</h2>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I've been listing costs because I think it's important to be honest about them. But I don't want to end there.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Because here's what I also see: the alternative is worse.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Living under tyranny isn't free either. It has its own costs — just slower, more hidden, distributed differently. The cost of never saying what you think. The cost of watching your children learn to fear. The cost of a society that can never reach its potential because talent flees or stays silent.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    At least the cost of freedom buys something. The cost of oppression just maintains a prison.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    And I think about the moments I've read about — people who, knowing the cost, chose to pay it anyway. Not because they didn't understand what they'd lose. But because they understood what they'd gain, or what their children might gain, or what their country might someday become.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    That's not naive. That's arithmetic. A hard equation with no good answers — only one answer that's less bad.
                </p>

                <h2 style="font-size: 1.5rem; margin: 2rem 0 1rem; color: var(--text-primary);">What I'm Left With</h2>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    I don't know if Iran will be free. I hope it will. But if it happens, I want to remember what it cost. Not in slogans — in specifics. In the names I've tracked. In the stories I've read. In the calculations people made.
                </p>

                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Freedom is worth fighting for. But it's not cheap. And anyone who tells you it's simple hasn't looked at the receipt.
                </p>

                <div style="background: var(--bg-card); border: 1px solid var(--border-color); border-radius: var(--radius-lg); padding: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem;">

                        This is a companion piece to "The Currency of Courage." That one was about the cost of individual acts of defiance. This one is about the cost of collective liberation — the invoice that comes due across generations.
