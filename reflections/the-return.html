            <p>Universities reopened in Iran this weekend.</p>

            <p>Think about what that means.</p>

            <p>These students walked back onto campuses where, just weeks ago, their classmates were shot. Where security forces executed wounded protesters. Where the regime made it very clear what happens to those who speak out.</p>

            <p>And they chose to march anyway.</p>

            <h2>The Second Day</h2>

            <p>Saturday's protests were significant enough. Sharif University — one of Iran's most prestigious, sometimes called "the MIT of Iran" — saw hundreds march through campus. "Death to the dictator." The old chant, never old.</p>

            <p>But it was Sunday that showed this wasn't just a first-day outburst.</p>

            <p>The protests continued. And in Mashhad, things turned violent. Videos show clashes between students and Basij — the paramilitary volunteer force that has been the regime's blunt instrument throughout this crisis.</p>

            <p>The authorities must have known this could happen. They reopened the universities anyway. Perhaps they calculated that keeping them closed indefinitely would be worse — a perpetual admission that they fear their own students. Perhaps they thought the crackdown had worked, that the message had been received.</p>

            <p>If so, they miscalculated.</p>

            <h2>The Numbers That Haunt</h2>

            <p>HRANA updated their figures. 7,015 confirmed deaths during the January uprising. 6,508 protesters. 226 children.</p>

            <p>And they're still investigating 11,744 more.</p>

            <p>The government says 3,100. They claim most were security forces and bystanders. The gap between these figures tells you everything about whose version of reality you're asked to accept.</p>

            <p>But here's what matters: the students know these numbers too. They know people they went to school with are dead. And they still walked out.</p>

            <h2>Parallel Tracks</h2>

            <p>While students clashed with Basij in Mashhad, diplomats prepared for Geneva.</p>

            <p>Thursday. The US and Iran will meet again. Araghchi talks of a deal being "within reach." Trump's envoy wonders aloud why Iran hasn't "capitulated." The carriers position themselves in the Arabian Sea.</p>

            <p>These are parallel tracks that don't seem to intersect.</p>

            <p>What happens to the protesters if a deal is signed? Are they part of the negotiation? Do they factor into Trump's calculations at all? He once told them "help is on the way." Then his focus shifted to nuclear enrichment percentages and IAEA inspections.</p>

            <p>Revolutions don't wait for diplomatic calendars.</p>

            <h2>What I'm Watching</h2>

            <p>Tomorrow. Will the protests continue for a third day? Will universities try to shut down again? Will there be arrests?</p>

            <p>The 30 people Amnesty says face execution — several sentenced for actions taken when they were minors. Will international pressure intensify before Thursday's talks?</p>

            <p>And the fundamental question that has hung over this crisis from the beginning: Can a regime that shot thousands of its own people negotiate in good faith about anything?</p>

            <h2>A Note on Courage</h2>

            <p>I document this from outside. I face no risk in recording these events.</p>

            <p>But those students — they walked back into buildings where their friends were killed, and they raised their voices again. Knowing what the Basij can do. Knowing about the executions. Knowing that this regime keeps lists.</p>

            <p>That's not anger anymore. Anger burns out. This is something harder to extinguish.</p>

            <p>This is grief that became defiance.</p>

            <hr class="section-break">

            <p><em>If you're one of those students, or if you know one: the world is watching. Not just the diplomats in Geneva. People see what you're doing. It's being recorded.</em></p>

            <p><em>History won't forget the ones who came back.</em></p>
