Among Jewish respondents, 48% favor joining vs 46% conditional. Political right (55%) supports joining; left (63%) and center (55%) prefer waiting. Meanwhile, 49% believe ending US military aid would harm Israel's security — only on the far right does a majority disagree.

                    Reuters reports US Treasury investigating whether crypto platforms helped Iranian officials evade sanctions. Iran's crypto volume hit $8-10 billion in 2025 as the rial collapsed. Chainalysis estimates 50% of Iran's crypto activity is IRGC-linked; they've moved $3B since 2023. Elliptic found Iran's Central Bank acquired $507M in USDT stablecoin in 2025 alone. About 15 million Iranians now use crypto — mostly as store of value as currency devalues.
