                    <h3>Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi Sentenced to 7+ More Years — On Hunger Strike Since Feb 2</h3>
                    <p>Iran has sentenced <strong>Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi</strong> to over seven more years in prison, her supporters said Sunday, as Tehran cracks down on all dissent following the nationwide protests. Mohammadi's lawyer confirmed the sentence was handed down Saturday by a Revolutionary Court in Mashhad: <strong>six years for "gathering and collusion," 1.5 years for propaganda, a 2-year travel ban, and 2 years internal exile</strong> to a remote southeastern city. Supporters say she has been on <strong>hunger strike since February 2</strong>. She had been arrested in December at a ceremony honoring a human rights lawyer. Mohammadi, 53, has suffered multiple heart attacks in prison and had emergency surgery in 2022. Her lawyer appealed for temporary release on bail for medical treatment. Meanwhile, judiciary chief Mohseni-Ejei signaled harsh sentences await many: "They are forlorn and will face damage."</p>

                    <h3>One Month Since the Massacre — Families Still Mourning, Instagram Post Shared 1.5 Million Times</h3>
                    <p>Exactly one month after the January 8-9 massacre, countless Iranian families remain in grief. An Instagram message calling on the international community to keep talking about Iran has been <strong>shared more than 1.5 million times</strong>: "One month ago today, thousands woke up and ate breakfast for the last time without knowing it, and kissed their mother for the last time without knowing it... They never returned." The UN Special Rapporteur on Iran estimated <strong>more than 20,000 may have been killed</strong> as information continues to trickle out despite heavy internet filtering. State television continues broadcasting forced confessions of arrested Iranians, many accused of working for foreign powers. Average Iranians feel left in limbo — as one Tehran resident told Al Jazeera: "Our best years are behind us. But it's even more sad that some youth born at the start of nuclear negotiations were killed on the streets with many hopes and dreams."</p>

                    <h3>Iran's Top Military Commander: "We Have the Necessary Power for a Long-Term War with the US"</h3>
                    <p>Iran's top military commander issued new warnings Sunday that the <strong>entire region will be engulfed in conflict</strong> if Iran is attacked. Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi told air force and air defense personnel: "While being prepared, we genuinely have no desire to see the outbreak of a regional war... but <strong>Iran has the necessary power and preparedness for a long-term war with the US.</strong>" He warned that aggressors will become "targets of the flames of regional war" that would "push back the advancement and development of the region by years." The threats come as the <strong>anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution approaches Wednesday</strong>, when state-organized demonstrations typically feature displays of ballistic missiles. Israeli PM Netanyahu is <strong>expected to travel to Washington this week</strong>, with Iran expected to be the major subject of discussion.</p>

                    <h3>Pezeshkian Calls for "Respect" — Iran's Strength Is "Power to Say No," Says FM Araghchi</h3>
                    <p>President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on X Sunday calling on the US to respect Iran: "The Iranian nation has always responded to respect with respect, but cannot withstand the language of force." He described the Oman talks as "a step forward" and said his administration favors dialogue. Speaking at a Tehran forum, FM Araghchi struck a harder line: <strong>"The secret of the Islamic Republic's power is the power to say no to the great powers... They fear our atomic bomb, while we are not pursuing an atomic bomb."</strong> His explicit use of "atomic bomb" as a rhetorical device likely wasn't accidental. Araghchi said Iran is unwilling to forgo nuclear enrichment even if it leads to more military attacks, "because no one has the right to tell us what we must have." He also said he told US envoys in Muscat that <strong>"there is no way but negotiations"</strong> — and that China and Russia have been informed of the talks' content.</p>

                    <p>The United States and Iran will hold a new round of talks "early this week" following Friday's meeting in Muscat, Oman. <strong>Neither side has changed their negotiating position</strong>, making a diplomatic breakthrough unlikely. Trump called the first talks "very good" but warned consequences will be "very steep" if Iran doesn't make a deal. Israeli media reports the US told Iran it expects a <strong>"tangible and significant concession"</strong> on its nuclear program. Meanwhile, FM Araghchi told Al Jazeera that Iran will keep enriched uranium inside the country, <strong>set enrichment levels "based on national needs"</strong>, and dismissed discussing anything outside the nuclear program — refusing to compromise on missiles or support for regional proxies. The regime fears protests could reemerge; leaked documents show plans to <strong>permanently restrict international internet access to only "trusted regime supporters"</strong> with security clearance.</p>

                    <p>The United Kingdom has announced a major package of sanctions targeting those responsible for human rights violations in Iran. <strong>Ten individuals and one organization</strong> have been designated, including Iran's <strong>Minister of the Interior, Police Chiefs, and prolific IRGC members</strong> for their role in the recent brutality against protesters. The announcement follows commitments by UK ministers earlier this month to hold Iranian authorities accountable. This adds to growing international pressure on the regime, which has already faced EU terror designation of the IRGC and multiple rounds of US sanctions since the January massacre.</p>

                    <p>New reports reveal <strong>growing dissent within Iran's security forces</strong> after the unprecedented massacre of protesters. An IRGC member speaking through an intermediary says he has <strong>not reported to work since January 8</strong> and refuses to return, citing "severe depression." He was shocked by the level of violence — and <strong>members of his own family were among the wounded or disappeared</strong>. A Tehran police officer says many rank-and-file officers are "on the verge of psychological collapse" and can't justify their work to their spouses and children: <strong>"We were not supposed to kill people in the streets."</strong> The IRGC Intelligence Organization issued unprecedented warnings against "insubordination, desertion or disobedience" — threatening special military courts and "harshest sentences." The directives reveal deep concern that <strong>veteran IRGC members and army forces might refuse to participate</strong> in killing civilians.</p>

                    <p>Leaked documents obtained by a US media outlet reveal the Iranian regime has been planning since at least <strong>August 2025 to permanently reshape Iran's internet</strong>: blocking foreign platforms, banning VPNs and circumvention tools, and enforcing reliance on state-approved technology "at every level." The plan was approved by the sanctioned head of the Supreme Cyberspace Council. According to internet monitor FilterWatch, <strong>only individuals with "security clearance" would have access to international internet</strong> — and "users' access to international internet will never return to its previous form." The plans suggest the regime fears protests could reemerge and is racing to securitize the digital ecosystem before they do.</p>

The military published photos of the carrier with aircraft flying overhead, captioned "Peace through Strength!" Iran's FM Araghchi said Tehran opposes transferring uranium abroad but is "ready to reduce the level of enrichment." <strong>Neither side moved much from initial positions</strong>.</p>

Trump also signed an executive order imposing secondary sanctions through <strong>25% tariffs on goods from countries that buy Iranian oil</strong>. The order gives the president legal basis to levy tariffs starting Saturday. The message is clear: diplomatic talks won't stop economic pressure.</p>

                    <p>A <strong>large fire broke out in a carpentry workshop inside a military base</strong> in eastern Tehran, with smoke visible across the Iranian capital. Firefighters managed to put out the blaze and there were no injuries according to Iranian news agencies. The cause of the fire has not been disclosed. Given the tense security situation, any incident at military facilities draws attention — though officials described this as an accident.</p>

                    <p>Despite severe internet blackouts and censorship, new field reports from Shiraz reveal <strong>nearly three weeks of intense urban battles</strong> between December 28, 2025 and January 13, 2026. The reports show a volatile society determined to overthrow the regime. <strong>The regime's suppression machine has been stretched to its breaking point</strong>, forcing authorities to call for reinforcements from neighboring cities to quell rebellious youth. Shiraz, the capital of Fars province, has become a "fortress of resistance" according to sources on the ground.</p>

Russia has reaffirmed its offer to take the uranium. However, Iranian hardliners including Shamkhani have rejected transferring uranium abroad — the regime remains deeply divided on specifics even as they head to the table.</p>

But the US still insists missiles, proxies, and protester treatment must eventually be addressed. Middle Eastern mediators have "downgraded expectations to near zero."</p>

                    <p>The last US-Russia nuclear arms control treaty expired overnight with no replacement. The global nuclear architecture that survived the Cold War is now gone — just as the world negotiates over Iran's nuclear program. Context: Iran has ~440kg of 60%-enriched uranium, a short technical step from weapons-grade. The mediator proposal would move this stockpile abroad.</p>

                    <h3>Israel Questions Its Influence Over US as Iran War Decision Nears</h3>
                    <p>Israeli analysts increasingly wonder whether Washington will prioritize its own geopolitical calculations over Israel's preferences on Iran. After Witkoff met Netanyahu and Mossad chiefs, gaps remain: Israel wants enriched uranium removed, enrichment stopped, missiles limited, proxy networks dismantled. But the US may settle for less if it secures its own strategic interests.</p>

                    <h3>IRGC Attempted to Seize US-Flagged Tanker; Third Confrontation in Days</h3>
                    <p>Two IRGC fast boats and a Mohajer drone approached tanker Stena Imperative in Strait of Hormuz, threatening to board. USS McFaul escorted with air support. Combined with the drone shootdown (Feb 3) and today's tanker seizures, the pattern is clear: Iran is demonstrating it can disrupt Gulf shipping at will — its strongest leverage card heading into talks.</p>
