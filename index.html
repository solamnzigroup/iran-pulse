                    <p><strong>Protests spread to their second day</strong> as students refuse to back down. Videos from Mashhad show <strong>violent clashes between students and the state-backed Basij militia</strong> — the paramilitary force responsible for much of January's crackdown. The Guardian reports protests "turned violent" on Sunday. Students at multiple universities returned to commemorating those killed in January and demanding accountability. The government had reopened universities perhaps calculating the crackdown had worked. <strong>They were wrong.</strong> These are the same students who know 7,015 of their countrymen died last month. They came back anyway.</p>

Iranian authorities claim 3,100 deaths, attributing most to "rioters" attacking security forces. <strong>HRANA is still investigating 11,744 additional reported deaths.</strong> The true scale may not be known for months.</p>

                    <p>The Guardian reports that US officials believe President <strong>Masoud Pezeshkian is becoming "increasingly sidelined"</strong> from both internal politics and nuclear negotiations. Power appears concentrated with <strong>Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi</strong> and <strong>SNSC Chair Ali Larijani</strong>. Underscoring this: the <strong>mass arrest of Pezeshkian's closest supporters</strong> in the Reformists Front coalition — the group instrumental in his 2024 election. Several face charges of "supporting foreign interests" for having criticized the crackdown. The reform president who campaigned on opening society now watches his allies imprisoned.</p>

BBC-verified footage shows protesters chanting <strong>"death to the dictator"</strong> (referring to Khamenei) before <strong>scuffles broke out with pro-government supporters</strong>. Verified protests also occurred at <strong>Shahid Beheshti University</strong> (peaceful sit-in), <strong>Amir Kabir University</strong> (anti-government chanting, Basij confrontation), and <strong>Mashhad Medical Sciences</strong> ("Freedom! Students, shout for your rights!"). HRANA has now confirmed <strong>7,015 deaths</strong> during January's crackdown (6,508 protesters, 226 children). Amnesty warns <strong>30 people, including minors, face execution</strong> — several sentenced when under 18.</p>

"Pleased to confirm... with a positive push to go the extra mile towards finalizing the deal," he tweeted. Trump envoy Steve Witkoff told Fox News the president is <strong>"curious" why Iran hasn't "capitulated"</strong> given the massive military buildup, though declined to say Trump is "frustrated." FM Araghchi expects to send a <strong>finalized draft proposal to Washington in 2-3 days</strong>. ISW analysis suggests Iran is unlikely to make meaningful concessions, possibly calculating a "conciliatory-sounding" proposal can delay strikes.</p>

                    <p>A major New York Times investigation based on <strong>interviews with 6 senior Iranian officials, 3 IRGC members, and 2 former diplomats</strong> reveals how Tehran is preparing for possible US strikes. Key revelations: <strong>Ali Larijani</strong> has been elevated to a critical role preparing for the "assassination scenario" — contingency plans if Khamenei is targeted. The report provides unprecedented insight into deliberations within Iran's leadership as they face Trump's ultimatum. Officials describe a two-track approach: negotiate seriously while preparing for the worst.</p>

                    <p><strong>President Trump acknowledged he is "considering" limited military strikes</strong> to pressure Tehran into a nuclear deal. "I guess I can say I am considering that," Trump told reporters at a White House press conference. This comes amid the <strong>largest US military buildup in the Middle East since the 2003 Iraq invasion</strong> — over 120 aircraft deployed in recent days, with the USS Gerald R Ford carrier joining the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group in the Arabian Sea. Trump previously warned "bad things" could happen if Iran doesn't agree within 10 days. Israeli officials believe the US and Iran are at an <strong>"unbridgeable impasse"</strong> and nearing open conflict. Secretary Rubio meeting Netanyahu on Feb 28 to discuss Iran.</p>

"We will not bow down in the face of any of these difficulties," he said. "World powers are lining up with cowardice to force us to bow our heads." FM Araghchi meanwhile struck a more diplomatic tone, saying a solution appears <strong>"within our reach"</strong> and Iran will finalize a draft deal <strong>"in the next two to three days"</strong> to send to Washington. Iran sent a letter to the UN Security Council emphasizing the US military buildup <strong>"must not be treated as mere rhetoric"</strong> — warning it will respond to any aggression. Tehran citizens interviewed by Al Jazeera expressed mixed views: some fear war, others insist "the US knows it can't overpower Iran."</p>

Citizens who initially gathered in front of regime intelligence headquarters <strong>quickly expanded into the city center</strong>, blocking roads and chanting "Death to Khamenei" and "Death to the dictator." Witnesses describe "a collective fury" replacing fear of security forces. Protesters explicitly stated that suppressive measures "will no longer result in silence but will instead fuel the fire of public anger and expand the scope of protests." This marks the 40-day mourning period transforming from private grief into open political defiance.</p>

In <strong>Gorgan</strong>, the mother of Nehayat Rahimi Dashti (shot in the throat) compared the regime to "today's Yazid" before declaring her daughter's death anniversary as their family's new "Tasua and Ashura." In <strong>Sharif University</strong>, students confronted Basij with the most radical slogans yet: <strong>"Until the mullah is shrouded, this homeland won't be a homeland"</strong> and "We'll fight, we'll die, we'll take Iran back." In <strong>Qir and Nurabad Mamasani</strong>, thousands chanted "Death to the IRGC" at gravesites. Family members are <strong>clapping, dancing, and playing drums</strong> in symbolic defiance of religious rituals favored by the state.</p>

                    <p>A major discrepancy in casualty figures emerged today. <strong>Trump told reporters "32,000 people were killed"</strong> during the protests, adding "the people of Iran have lived in hell." FM Araghchi responded that Iran published a list of <strong>3,117 victims (including ~200 security personnel)</strong>, calling it a "terrorist operation" and demanding "If anyone disputes accuracy of our data, please share any evidence." The US-based <strong>HRANA has verified 7,114 deaths</strong> with 11,700 more cases under investigation. UN Special Rapporteur Mai Sato noted the <strong>actual figure is "likely much higher"</strong> than official counts, emphasizing the unprecedented scale reaching every province.</p>

                    <p>A joint statement signed by <strong>30 UN special rapporteurs and human rights experts</strong> called on Iranian authorities to fully disclose the fate and whereabouts of tens of thousands arrested, forcibly disappeared, or missing. The experts demanded Iran <strong>halt all protest-related death sentences and executions</strong>. They noted: "The vast majority of those detained or killed are <strong>ordinary people, including children</strong>, from all provinces and diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, as well as Afghan nationals" — plus lawyers, medical professionals, journalists, and human rights defenders. The experts condemned what they called "forced confessions" regularly broadcast on state media.</p>

                    <p>Students at universities in Tehran and Mashhad held <strong>anti-regime rallies today</strong>, according to Iran International. At <strong>Beheshti University</strong>, students held a sit-in to honor those killed in January's crackdown and support imprisoned students. At <strong>Amirkabir University</strong>, protesters chanted "long live the king" (referencing Reza Pahlavi). At <strong>Sharif University</strong>, the Basij militia attacked the rally, with footage showing students chanting "shameless" at militia operatives. Security forces blocked Amirkabir's exits and detained students. At <strong>Mashhad Medical Sciences</strong>, students chanted "freedom." The protests mark a resurgence of campus resistance after the 40-day mourning period.</p>

                    <p>President Trump told reporters Friday that he is <strong>"considering a limited military strike to pressure Iran into a deal"</strong>. The statement confirms the military posture while maintaining negotiating pressure. Iran's FM says a <strong>draft nuclear agreement could be ready "in the next few days"</strong> following the Feb 17 Geneva talks mediated by Oman. However, ISW analysis suggests <strong>Iran is unlikely to make meaningful nuclear concessions</strong>, potentially calculating that a conciliatory-sounding proposal can delay strikes. Democrats are urging congressional approval before any military action. Trump's 10-15 day deadline from Feb 19 continues to tick.</p>

PM Keir Starmer told Trump that strikes from British territory — including Diego Garcia and RAF Fairford — would breach international law. Trump responded furiously, withdrawing US support for the UK's Chagos Islands transfer to Mauritius and posting "DO NOT GIVE AWAY DIEGO GARCIA!" on Truth Social. Diego Garcia has historically served as a launch point for US air campaigns in the region. The dispute highlights fractures within the Western alliance as military action looms.</p>

With Trump weighing "limited strikes" while simultaneously negotiating, analysts warn of miscalculation. The article notes that while the US and Israel have military advantages, <strong>Iran has ways to make any attack painful</strong> — including proxy attacks, disruption of oil shipping through Hormuz, and potential retaliation against US bases and regional partners.</p>

                    <p>ISW reports <strong>19 protests across eight provinces on Feb 19</strong> — the most on a single day since January 11. <strong>Five protests exceeded 1,000 participants</strong>, a milestone not seen since the initial uprising. The protests marked the <strong>40-day mourning period</strong> (arba'een) for those killed on Jan 8-9. "These protests illustrate that the motivations driving the initial days of the protest movement have not abated," ISW concluded. The regime's pause in mass protests during late January/early February appears to be ending. The 40th day of mourning holds deep significance in Shia Islam — and Iranians used it to return to the streets.</p>

Human rights groups report up to <strong>30,000-43,000 killed</strong> vs. regime's claim of 3,000.

Families of detainees are <strong>forced to attend pro-regime rallies</strong> and provide proof of participation as a condition for bail. Despite the crackdown, student protests and nighttime anti-government slogans continue.</p>

The "coup de grâce" — the practice of delivering a final, fatal shot to the wounded — was <strong>widely used</strong> during the suppression, according to his February 19 press conference. This is the first official acknowledgment of what human rights groups have documented: a systematic pattern of finishing off wounded demonstrators. The admission comes as the regime struggles to contain a society that has shifted from economic grievances to open calls for regime change.</p>

                    <p>Multiple US outlets (NYT, CBS, CNN) report the Pentagon has <strong>assembled sufficient air and naval resources to strike Iran in the coming days</strong>. The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier group is already in region; the USS Gerald R. Ford is en route (currently off West Africa). <strong>50+ fighter jets and dozens of refueling tankers deployed.</strong> According to Barak Ravid, US sources called Geneva talks a <strong>"nothingburger"</strong> and Iran has until <strong>end of February</strong> to offer concessions. Pentagon preparing for "joint Israeli-US offensive that could last weeks." Trump hasn't made final decision but is "spending a lot of time thinking about this." White House: <strong>"Iran would be very wise to make a deal."</strong></p>

                    <p>As US moves additional forces toward the Middle East, <strong>Iran and Russia announced joint naval drills</strong>. Both nations "leaned into gunboat diplomacy" — Tehran demonstrating its strategic partnership with Moscow while US brings a second aircraft carrier closer. Russian FM Lavrov warned: <strong>"Consequences are not good"</strong> of any US strike. "No one wants an increase in tension. Everyone understands this is playing with fire." Iran's Khamenei posted AI-generated image of USS Gerald Ford in a "maritime grave" with caption: <strong>"More dangerous than that warship is the weapon that can send it to the bottom of the sea."</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>For the first time since US military threats began, Iran has closed parts of the Strait of Hormuz</strong> — the crucial chokepoint through which 20% of the world's oil passes. Iranian state media announced the closure for "several hours" for "safety and maritime concerns" as IRGC forces conducted live-fire military exercises. The semi-official Tasnim news agency reported that <strong>missiles launched from inside Iran and along its coast struck targets in the Strait</strong>. The move comes during ongoing nuclear talks in Geneva — a clear demonstration of Tehran's ability to disrupt global energy supplies if diplomacy fails. Iran-Russia have also announced a joint military drill.</p>

The system uses <strong>AI to speed up case processing</strong> for detained protesters. Ejei declared there must be "decisive and uncompromising treatment" and emphasized acting "without any leniency" — rushing executions before public anger can build. Human advancement twisted into a tool for faster killing.</p>

                    <p>Iran's Foreign Minister <strong>Abbas Araghchi</strong> announced that <strong>"the path for a deal has started"</strong> after the second round of US-Iran nuclear talks concluded in Geneva. Tehran and Washington reached an understanding on <strong>"the main principles"</strong> during "very serious discussions" — though issues still remain. This is the most significant progress in US-Iran relations in years, though the hard work of converting principles into an actual deal lies ahead.</p>

                    <p>The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) reports that <strong>the Iranian regime has sentenced hundreds of protesters to death</strong> and <strong>killed thousands of detained protesters</strong>, according to Israeli media citing human rights organizations and Iranian sources. This comes as "diplomatic progress" in Geneva dominates headlines. The report notes security forces have systematically executed detainees while the world focuses on nuclear negotiations. The chasm between the "good progress" rhetoric and the reality inside Iran's prisons could not be wider.</p>

                    <p>The <strong>second round of US-Iran nuclear negotiations begins today in Geneva</strong>, with Oman mediating. Iran announced it will <strong>partially shut down the Strait of Hormuz</strong> — a vital global oil supply route — as leverage during talks. State media framed it as demonstrating Tehran's ability to control the waterway. <strong>Trump said he will be "involved indirectly"</strong> in the talks. Iran is bringing detailed economic proposals including potential deals on <strong>energy, mining, and aircraft</strong> purchases in exchange for sanctions relief. Tehran says it won't accept "zero enrichment" but signals flexibility on stockpile limits. The US has deployed a second aircraft carrier to the region and is preparing for "potentially weeks-long" operations if diplomacy fails.</p>

                    <p>According to NCRI reports cited by Fox News, <strong>tens of thousands of Iranians are being held in "black box" detention sites</strong> with no judicial oversight, no official records, and no way for families to confirm if their loved ones are alive. The facilities are modeled on <strong>prison camps from the 1980s</strong> — residential compounds inside Ghezel Hesar Prison in Karaj. During that era, female MEK-affiliated prisoners were <strong>"confined in coffin-like boxes, deprived of sleep and food."</strong> Human rights advocates warn this systematic disappearance infrastructure has been reactivated for the current crackdown.</p>

Their message: rejection of both the clerical dictatorship AND any return to monarchy. The activities come in the wake of the <strong>January 2026 uprising</strong>, which the resistance calls the "countdown to the regime's overthrow." In Malmö, Sweden, MEK supporters held a rally and photo exhibition calling for an end to executions. In Kermanshah, <strong>Social Security retirees protested</strong> outside the local office, chanting: "Our tables are empty of bread, stained instead with our blood."</p>

Meanwhile, the <strong>IRGC launched naval drills</strong> in the Strait of Hormuz called "Smart Control of Hormuz Strait" — testing readiness against "possible security and military threats" as US warships amass nearby. Hardliner MP <strong>Hamid Rasaei</strong> (Paydari faction) warned parliament against giving IAEA access before security guarantees. Secretary of State <strong>Rubio</strong> from Hungary: "I think there's an opportunity... But I don't want to overstate it. It's going to be hard. We're dealing with radical Shia clerics making theological decisions."</p>

Additional rallies in Los Angeles, Sydney, Melbourne, Nicosia (500), and across Australia. <strong>Reza Pahlavi</strong> warned: "If democracies stand by and watch, there will be more deaths... The survival of Iran's government sends a clear signal to every bully: kill enough people and you stay in power."</p>

                    <p>A Guardian analysis warns that <strong>similarities between now and events preceding the shah's 1979 exile are striking</strong>. The question: "The radical clerics benefited then, but who would prevail this time?" The piece notes the current regime faces unprecedented pressure from both internal protests and external military threats, creating conditions not seen since the revolution. Nobody knows what would follow regime change — a concern for both supporters and opponents of the current government.</p>

Protesters demand governments revoke recognition of the Islamic Republic and support transition to secular democracy. In Munich, <strong>Reza Pahlavi</strong> addressed the Security Conference: "This struggle is about freedom, equality, freedom of speech, democracy at the ballot box." He called for cutting off the regime's "financial lifelines in full" and dismantling its "machinery of oppression." Many marched with roses, signs, flags, and prop nooses and body bags to symbolize the crackdown's brutality.</p>

                    <p>An AP investigation reveals the scope of Iran's post-protest crackdown: <strong>security forces conduct 2 AM raids on homes and workplaces</strong>, pulling people from sleep, forcing phone passwords, and disappearing them into prisons. The dragnet touches all of society — <strong>university students, doctors, lawyers, teachers, actors, business owners, athletes, filmmakers</strong>, and reformist politicians. Detainees held <strong>incommunicado for days or weeks</strong>, denied legal counsel, while authorities review municipal cameras and drone footage to track protesters. HRANA counts <strong>53,000+ arrested</strong> including 107 students, 82 children as young as 13, 106 doctors, and 19 lawyers. A protester: "It's like a whole suffocation of society."</p>

Human rights groups say the IRGC and Ministry of Intelligence contacted families demanding they attend pro-regime marches and record videos displaying "loyalty" — or face harsher sentences, including execution. Prominent businessman <strong>Mohamed Saedinia</strong>, owner of Tehran's beloved liberal cafes, was forced to publish a groveling apology and attend regime celebrations after being arrested with his son. Rights groups called it "a complete cycle of mental and physical torture."</p>

                    <h3>Four Prominent Reformist Politicians Arrested — Charged with Working for Israel and US</h3>
                    <p>Iranian authorities have arrested <strong>four prominent reformist politicians</strong> overnight, charging them with attempting to "disrupt the country's political and social order" and working "for the benefit" of Israel and the US during the January protests. Those detained include <strong>Azar Mansouri</strong> (head of Iran's Reformists Front), <strong>Mohsen Aminzadeh</strong> (former deputy foreign minister under Khatami), <strong>Ebrahim Asgharzadeh</strong> (former parliamentarian who participated in the 1979 US embassy takeover), and <strong>Javad Emam</strong> (Reformists Front spokesman). The IRGC intelligence forces have also summoned other senior members including deputy chairman Mohsen Armin. The judiciary claimed they were "organising and leading extensive activities aimed at disrupting the political and social situation" while Iran faced "military threats." The Reformists Front had recently called for sweeping reforms and an independent fact-finding mission after the massacre. Analysts say this signals the regime is "closing any avenues for political dissent and ruling with an iron fist."</p>

                    <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will travel to Washington on <strong>February 11 to discuss Iran</strong> with President Trump. Israeli defense officials told US counterparts that <strong>Iran's ballistic missile program poses an "existential threat"</strong> to Israel. The officials noted Israel is <strong>prepared to launch a unilateral attack</strong> against Iran to destroy its missile stockpiles and production facilities if Iran crosses an unspecified "red line." The announcement came hours after Trump said a deal with Iran that "only covers nuclear issues" would be acceptable — a potentially significant shift. Israeli officials have consistently said negotiations must include limitations on Iran's ballistic missile program, setting up a potential disagreement with the US approach.</p>

                    <p>Hours after the Muscat talks adjourned, the Trump administration <strong>announced new sanctions on Iranian oil firms and ships</strong> connected to "illicit trade" that "generates revenue the regime uses for malign activities." Trump also signed an <strong>Executive Order establishing authority for 25% tariffs on imports from nations doing business with Iran</strong> — a major economic weapon not yet deployed. Meanwhile, the IRGC <strong>seized two oil tankers</strong> claiming fuel smuggling, and <strong>launched several drones toward the USS Abraham Lincoln</strong> carrier strike group in the Arabian Sea — one was shot down by US forces for posing a threat. In response, Trump's envoys Witkoff and Kushner <strong>visited the Lincoln on Saturday</strong> alongside CENTCOM Commander Admiral Cooper to emphasize US military power. Reports also indicate Trump's team is <strong>organizing a meeting of Iranian dissident leaders</strong> to plan for a post-regime Iran — signaling regime change remains on the table even as diplomacy proceeds.</p>

Separately, IRGC-affiliated Fars News warned Iran may <strong>target supply centers and ports in the region</strong> if attacked by the US or Israel — specifically implying the <strong>King Fahd Industrial Port in Jubail, Saudi Arabia</strong>, one of the Middle East's largest industrial ports handling 20% of Saudi trade. The US uses Saudi port facilities as key logistics and prepositioning points. An attack could close the port with significant impacts on oil exports and global markets.</p>

At Friday prayers in Tehran, Assembly of Experts member Ahmad Khatami expressed terror at the regime's isolation online, calling public rejection of the regime on the internet a <strong>"soft coup"</strong> and desperately pleading for "Hezbollah youth" to counter the flood of anti-regime sentiment. The regime has clearly lost the narrative war.</p>

Pahlavi's statement lists six demands for the international community to address.

                    <p>Exactly one month after the January 8-9 massacre, countless Iranian families remain in grief. An Instagram message calling on the international community to keep talking about Iran has been <strong>shared more than 1.5 million times</strong>: "One month ago today, thousands woke up and ate breakfast for the last time without knowing it, and kissed their mother for the last time without knowing it... They never returned." The UN Special Rapporteur on Iran estimated <strong>more than 20,000 may have been killed</strong> as information continues to trickle out despite heavy internet filtering. State television continues broadcasting forced confessions of arrested Iranians, many accused of working for foreign powers. Average Iranians feel left in limbo — as one Tehran resident told Al Jazeera: "Our best years are behind us. But it's even more sad that some youth born at the start of nuclear negotiations were killed on the streets with many hopes and dreams."</p>

                    <h3>Iran's Top Military Commander: "We Have the Necessary Power for a Long-Term War with the US"</h3>
                    <p>Iran's top military commander issued new warnings Sunday that the <strong>entire region will be engulfed in conflict</strong> if Iran is attacked. Major General Abdolrahim Mousavi told air force and air defense personnel: "While being prepared, we genuinely have no desire to see the outbreak of a regional war... but <strong>Iran has the necessary power and preparedness for a long-term war with the US.</strong>" He warned that aggressors will become "targets of the flames of regional war" that would "push back the advancement and development of the region by years." The threats come as the <strong>anniversary of the 1979 Islamic Revolution approaches Wednesday</strong>, when state-organized demonstrations typically feature displays of ballistic missiles. Israeli PM Netanyahu is <strong>expected to travel to Washington this week</strong>, with Iran expected to be the major subject of discussion.</p>

                    <h3>Pezeshkian Calls for "Respect" — Iran's Strength Is "Power to Say No," Says FM Araghchi</h3>
                    <p>President Masoud Pezeshkian wrote on X Sunday calling on the US to respect Iran: "The Iranian nation has always responded to respect with respect, but cannot withstand the language of force." He described the Oman talks as "a step forward" and said his administration favors dialogue. Speaking at a Tehran forum, FM Araghchi struck a harder line: <strong>"The secret of the Islamic Republic's power is the power to say no to the great powers... They fear our atomic bomb, while we are not pursuing an atomic bomb."</strong> His explicit use of "atomic bomb" as a rhetorical device likely wasn't accidental. Araghchi said Iran is unwilling to forgo nuclear enrichment even if it leads to more military attacks, "because no one has the right to tell us what we must have." He also said he told US envoys in Muscat that <strong>"there is no way but negotiations"</strong> — and that China and Russia have been informed of the talks' content.</p>

                    <p>The United States and Iran will hold a new round of talks "early this week" following Friday's meeting in Muscat, Oman. <strong>Neither side has changed their negotiating position</strong>, making a diplomatic breakthrough unlikely. Trump called the first talks "very good" but warned consequences will be "very steep" if Iran doesn't make a deal. Israeli media reports the US told Iran it expects a <strong>"tangible and significant concession"</strong> on its nuclear program. Meanwhile, FM Araghchi told Al Jazeera that Iran will keep enriched uranium inside the country, <strong>set enrichment levels "based on national needs"</strong>, and dismissed discussing anything outside the nuclear program — refusing to compromise on missiles or support for regional proxies. The regime fears protests could reemerge; leaked documents show plans to <strong>permanently restrict international internet access to only "trusted regime supporters"</strong> with security clearance.</p>

                    <p>The United Kingdom has announced a major package of sanctions targeting those responsible for human rights violations in Iran. <strong>Ten individuals and one organization</strong> have been designated, including Iran's <strong>Minister of the Interior, Police Chiefs, and prolific IRGC members</strong> for their role in the recent brutality against protesters. The announcement follows commitments by UK ministers earlier this month to hold Iranian authorities accountable. This adds to growing international pressure on the regime, which has already faced EU terror designation of the IRGC and multiple rounds of US sanctions since the January massacre.</p>

                    <p>New reports reveal <strong>growing dissent within Iran's security forces</strong> after the unprecedented massacre of protesters. An IRGC member speaking through an intermediary says he has <strong>not reported to work since January 8</strong> and refuses to return, citing "severe depression." He was shocked by the level of violence — and <strong>members of his own family were among the wounded or disappeared</strong>. A Tehran police officer says many rank-and-file officers are "on the verge of psychological collapse" and can't justify their work to their spouses and children: <strong>"We were not supposed to kill people in the streets."</strong> The IRGC Intelligence Organization issued unprecedented warnings against "insubordination, desertion or disobedience" — threatening special military courts and "harshest sentences." The directives reveal deep concern that <strong>veteran IRGC members and army forces might refuse to participate</strong> in killing civilians.</p>

                    <p>Leaked documents obtained by a US media outlet reveal the Iranian regime has been planning since at least <strong>August 2025 to permanently reshape Iran's internet</strong>: blocking foreign platforms, banning VPNs and circumvention tools, and enforcing reliance on state-approved technology "at every level." The plan was approved by the sanctioned head of the Supreme Cyberspace Council. According to internet monitor FilterWatch, <strong>only individuals with "security clearance" would have access to international internet</strong> — and "users' access to international internet will never return to its previous form." The plans suggest the regime fears protests could reemerge and is racing to securitize the digital ecosystem before they do.</p>

                    <h3>Egypt, Turkey & Qatar Propose Framework — Zero Enrichment for 3 Years</h3>
                    <p>According to ISW analysis, Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar have proposed a negotiating framework: Iran would commit to zero uranium enrichment for three years, then limit enrichment below 1.5%, transfer its highly enriched uranium to a third country, and halt all weapons transfers to proxies. Russia has reaffirmed its offer to take the uranium. However, Iranian hardliners including Shamkhani have rejected transferring uranium abroad — the regime remains deeply divided on specifics even as they head to the table.</p>

                    <p>President Pezeshkian appointed Ali Shamkhani as secretary of the SNSC's Defense Council — Iran's highest security decision-making body. But this is clearly at Khamenei's behest: Shamkhani is the Supreme Leader's representative on the council. The move indicates Khamenei is consolidating hardliner control over defense policy heading into negotiations. Shamkhani has publicly rejected transferring uranium abroad and vowed Iran will never negotiate over its missiles or Axis of Resistance.</p>

                    <p>In an NBC interview, Trump warned Iran's Supreme Leader "should be very worried." He revealed Iran attempted to start a new nuclear site after the June bombings: "We found out about it. I said, 'You do that, we're going to do bad things to you.'" He claimed Arab states are "not afraid of Iran anymore" after the US strikes. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Bessent told the Senate that Iranian officials are "wiring money out like crazy" — describing regime leaders as "abandoning ship" amid a severe dollar shortage engineered by US sanctions.</p>

                    <p>The Friday talks almost fell apart when Iran demanded bilateral-only format in Oman; the US initially said "this or nothing" and Iran walked away. Arab and Muslim states urgently lobbied the White House not to abandon negotiations. Late Wednesday, both sides confirmed talks are back on for Friday in Muscat — bilateral, focused on nuclear issues. But the US still insists missiles, proxies, and protester treatment must eventually be addressed. Middle Eastern mediators have "downgraded expectations to near zero."</p>

The beloved Saedinia cafe chain — a cultural symbol — seized and owner arrested for "supporting rioters." Prosecutor orders asset seizures of celebrities who backed protests. Newspaper Ham Mihan shuttered — first since 2016. Families of slain protesters forced to sign pledges "not to cry" at funerals. ~40,000 people detained total. Rights groups call it "the most sweeping repression in the Islamic Republic's history."</p>

Multiple countries have offered to house the stockpile — all rejected.</p>

The volatility underscores how the world's economy hangs on tomorrow's meeting in Muscat.</p>

Iran regularly uses seizures as leverage, but timing — hours before Muscat talks — sends a clear signal of defiance.</p>
