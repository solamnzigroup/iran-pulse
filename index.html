                    <p>The stage is set for the first direct US-Iran talks since the June bombings. US special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have arrived in Doha and will proceed to Muscat. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is already in the Omani capital. Talks begin Friday at 10 AM local time (6:00 AM GMT). <strong>Critical development:</strong> NYT reports both sides made "mutual concessions" — contrary to Iran's public stance, the talks will cover not just the nuclear program but also missiles and militant proxies. Expectations remain at rock bottom, but the fact they're meeting at all is significant.</p>

                    <p>According to ISW analysis, Egypt, Turkey, and Qatar have proposed a negotiating framework: Iran would commit to zero uranium enrichment for three years, then limit enrichment below 1.5%, transfer its highly enriched uranium to a third country, and halt all weapons transfers to proxies. Russia has reaffirmed its offer to take the uranium. However, Iranian hardliners including Shamkhani have rejected transferring uranium abroad — the regime remains deeply divided on specifics even as they head to the table.</p>

                    <p>President Pezeshkian appointed Ali Shamkhani as secretary of the SNSC's Defense Council — Iran's highest security decision-making body. But this is clearly at Khamenei's behest: Shamkhani is the Supreme Leader's representative on the council. The move indicates Khamenei is consolidating hardliner control over defense policy heading into negotiations. Shamkhani has publicly rejected transferring uranium abroad and vowed Iran will never negotiate over its missiles or Axis of Resistance.</p>

                    <p>In an NBC interview, Trump warned Iran's Supreme Leader "should be very worried." He revealed Iran attempted to start a new nuclear site after the June bombings: "We found out about it. I said, 'You do that, we're going to do bad things to you.'" He claimed Arab states are "not afraid of Iran anymore" after the US strikes. Meanwhile, Treasury Secretary Bessent told the Senate that Iranian officials are "wiring money out like crazy" — describing regime leaders as "abandoning ship" amid a severe dollar shortage engineered by US sanctions.</p>

                    <p>The Friday talks almost fell apart when Iran demanded bilateral-only format in Oman; the US initially said "this or nothing" and Iran walked away. Arab and Muslim states urgently lobbied the White House not to abandon negotiations. Late Wednesday, both sides confirmed talks are back on for Friday in Muscat — bilateral, focused on nuclear issues. But the US still insists missiles, proxies, and protester treatment must eventually be addressed. Middle Eastern mediators have "downgraded expectations to near zero."</p>

The beloved Saedinia cafe chain — a cultural symbol — seized and owner arrested for "supporting rioters." Prosecutor orders asset seizures of celebrities who backed protests. Newspaper Ham Mihan shuttered — first since 2016. Families of slain protesters forced to sign pledges "not to cry" at funerals. ~40,000 people detained total. Rights groups call it "the most sweeping repression in the Islamic Republic's history."</p>

Shiraz medical students and Tabriz dental students held high-profile protest sit-ins. Underground networks of doctors continue treating the wounded in secret — CNN documented an underground medic network operating despite the crackdown reaching hospitals.</p>

But she stressed the stockpiles "belong to Iran" and the decision is Tehran's. Iran has so far refused, insisting it has the sovereign right to enrich uranium on its own territory. Multiple countries have offered to house the stockpile — all rejected.</p>

Markets are pricing in the real possibility that diplomacy fails and the US strikes — Iranian crude supply disruption would have major global energy implications. The volatility underscores how the world's economy hangs on tomorrow's meeting in Muscat.</p>

Iran regularly uses seizures as leverage, but timing — hours before Muscat talks — sends a clear signal of defiance.</p>

Its 440kg stockpile of 60%-enriched uranium transferred to a third country. Iran pledges no weapons transfers to proxies, no first-use of ballistic missiles. A US-Iran nonaggression pact proposed. Goes far beyond nuclear — but Iran insists it will "exclusively" discuss nuclear + sanctions.</p>

The global nuclear architecture that survived the Cold War is now gone — just as the world negotiates over Iran's nuclear program. Context: Iran has ~440kg of 60%-enriched uranium, a short technical step from weapons-grade. The mediator proposal would move this stockpile abroad.</p>

After Witkoff met Netanyahu and Mossad chiefs, gaps remain: Israel wants enriched uranium removed, enrichment stopped, missiles limited, proxy networks dismantled. But the US may settle for less if it secures its own strategic interests.</p>

                    <h3>IRGC Attempted to Seize US-Flagged Tanker; Third Confrontation in Days</h3>
                    <p>Two IRGC fast boats and a Mohajer drone approached tanker Stena Imperative in Strait of Hormuz, threatening to board. USS McFaul escorted with air support. Combined with the drone shootdown (Feb 3) and today's tanker seizures, the pattern is clear: Iran is demonstrating it can disrupt Gulf shipping at will — its strongest leverage card heading into talks.</p>

                    <h3>Before Muscat</h3>
                    <p>The night before the first US-Iran talks. Everything converged today — the tanker confrontation, the Xi call, the confirmed talks. But also the screenwriter arrested, the artists torn apart, the BBC counting bodies. Tomorrow, 85 million hold their breath.</p>

                    <p>A Shahed drone approached the USS Abraham Lincoln. An F-35 shot it down. First direct US-Iran military engagement. A line crossed — and whatever comes next, comes after this.</p>

                    <p>Khamenei called the protests a "coup" that was "crushed." But movements aren't buildings — you can't point to rubble. The word he should fear isn't "crushed." It's "remembered."</p>
